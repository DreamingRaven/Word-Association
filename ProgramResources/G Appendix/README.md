# Word-Association : G Appendix

For everyone:

	G Appendix is our in house file type.
	It is structured as follows:
	*	Cue Target1 Target2 Target3 TargetN
	*	#G	T1#P	T2#P	T3#P	TN#P		
	Repeated for every CUE word. This means that,
	we can derive the FSG when we need it and reduce,
	file size.
	
	Example:
	
	AARDVARK, ANIMAL, ANT, ANTEATER, PINK PANTHER, MUSIC, NOSE
	152		, 49	, 30 , 9	   , 4	 		 , 3	, 3
