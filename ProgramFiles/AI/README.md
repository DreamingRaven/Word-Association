# Word-Association : Solution

For Everyone:
	
	Made a decision to turn to the dark side
	here and use VS, so that everyone could
	use the IDE and reduce hassle with
	teaching different IDEs.
	
For Team:

	File class now takes file data as 
	vector<vector<char*>> creating a
	C++11 dynamic jagged array.
	Still working on an efficient,
	read in function.
	
to do:
	
	-	finish checking "File" psudo
	-	implement "File" code
	-	start "Concept"
