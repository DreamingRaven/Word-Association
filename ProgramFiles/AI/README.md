# Word-Association : Solution

For Everyone:
	
	Made a decision to turn to the dark side
	here and use VS, so that everyone could
	use the IDE and reduce hassle with
	teaching different IDEs.
	
For Team:

	Spent a while fiddling with our database
	files, they are now all perfect and
	mostly documented, they still need row
	by row documentation but there are 
	only so many hours in today.
	I have started to sort out "File" class
	but it still  needs some TL&C. We need
	to be extra carefull as all of the files
	have different formating and certain
	files like READMEs need to be ignored.
	It should inteligentley read a whole
	directory or a single file, ready
	for passing on to instances of
	"Concept". Consideration must also be
	given to backwards cases, where 
	we could be trying to create a new file
	or modifying existing by concatenating
	instances of "Concept". I wanted to 
	finish it off this evening, but 
	I had to sort out our source data first,
	and live.
	
to do:
	
	-	finish checking "File" psudo
	-	implement "File" code
	-	start "Concept"
